# Convolutional Neural Networks - Image Classification

The objective of this project is to carry out supervised image classification on a collection of cats and dogs images. It employs a convolutional neural network design and applies sigmoid activation function and transformations to recognize the category of images from a predefined set of 2 classes (Cats and Dogs)
